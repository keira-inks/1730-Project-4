# Project 4 - Multithreaded Diagonal Sums

## CSCI1730 Systems Programming @UGA

### Project Description
This project will find all of the diagonal sums equal to an input *s*, an unsigned long value, in an input text file consisting of a 2D grid of *n*-by-*n* digits (1 through 9), where *n*>=1, using *t* threads, where 1<=*t*<=3. Program will write the output of all the diagonal sums equal to *s* to an output file.
